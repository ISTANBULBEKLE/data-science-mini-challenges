# Groups maximisation problem

## Definition

A tutor at a university in the west of England has a module where groups will work together. The tutor wants to create a series of groupings, such that each person is likely to get to meet and work with the maximum number of their fellow coursemates over several iterations. There are 80 students and they will work in groups of 4.

## Task

Create a sorting algorithm to randomly assign the students to groups. Importantly, it should have a memory, so that on each subsequent sort, students are likely to be working with new people.

This can be done in any format, but a Python implementation would be useful. Also useful would be the ability to load a CSV of students and create the groups.
