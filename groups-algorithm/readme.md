# Groups maximisation problem

## Definition

A tutor at a university in the West of England has a module where groups will work together. The tutor wants to create a series of groupings, such that each person is likely to get to meet and work with the maximum number of their fellow coursemates over several iterations. There are 80 students and they will work in groups of 4.

## Challenges

There are sure to be solutions to this problem you can find on the web. But you will probably get more out of it if you try to solve it yourself first!

1. Create a sorting algorithm to randomly assign the students to groups. Importantly, it should have a memory, so that on each subsequent sort, students are working with new people. Use Excel, Word or just a pen and paper. The algorithm can be expressed as a series of steps (like a recipe).

2. (Advanced) Create a Python implementation that can load a CSV of students and create the groups for N iterations.
